# Basic SQL

This repository contains sample SQL queries and data for learning and practicing SQL. 

## Queries

The [`queries`](./Queries/) folder contains several SQL files that demonstrate how to perform basic SQL operations such as selecting, filtering, sorting, inserting, updating, and deleting data from a table. Each file contains a brief description of the query it demonstrates.

- [`select_data.sql`](./queries/select_data.sql): Demonstrates how to select data from a table using the SELECT statement.
- [`filter_data.sql`](./queries/filter_data.sql): Demonstrates how to filter data using the WHERE clause.
- [`sort_data.sql`](./queries/sort_data.sql): Demonstrates how to sort data using the ORDER BY clause.
- [`insert_data.sql`](./queries/insert_data.sql): Demonstrates how to insert data into a table using the INSERT statement.
- [`update_data.sql`](./queries/update_data.sql): Demonstrates how to update data in a table using the UPDATE statement.
- [`delete_data.sql`](./queries/delete_data.sql): Demonstrates how to delete data from a table using the DELETE statement.

## Data

The [`data`](./Data/) folder contains sample data in CSV format that can be imported into a SQL database. This data was generated for the purpose of showcasing SQL skills and is not based on any real-world data. The database contains eight tables:

- [`customers.csv`](customers.csv): contains a list of customers
- [`products.csv`](products.csv): contains a list of products
- [`suppliers.csv`](suppliers.csv): contains a list of suppliers
- [`inventory.csv`](inventory.csv): contains inventory information
- [`orders.csv`](orders.csv): contains a list of orders
- [`order_items.csv`](order_items.csv): contains information about items in each order
- [`shipping.csv`](shipping.csv): contains information about shipping
- [`returns.csv`](returns.csv): contains information about returns
